For detailed instructions, see the setup guides specific to your operating system in `docs/setup_instructions/`.
Each document should be similarly comprehensive and self-contained, providing all the necessary information for that section's topic. It's also a good idea to make sure documentation is searchable, and you might consider using a documentation generator for better formatting and navigation, such as Sphinx for Python projects or JSDoc for JavaScript.

With a well-organized and detailed docs/ directory, contributors can quickly find the information they need, reducing the learning curve and facilitating easier onboarding of new collaborators.
